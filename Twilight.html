            Despite the danger, Bella and Edward fall deeply in love. Their relationship grows complicated as Edward struggles between 
            his love for Bella and his instinct to protect her from his world. Trouble strikes when another vampire, James, becomes 
            obsessed with hunting Bella for sport. Edward and his family risk everything to save her, leading to a dramatic showdown. In 
            the end, Bella survives but realizes that being with Edward means living in constant danger—and she begins to consider the 
            possibility of becoming a vampire herself.</p>
